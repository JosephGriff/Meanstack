<p>This is my Angular Mean App which I have created for the module Data Representation & Querying in GMIT. I decided to make a simple bookshelf app, where you can add,remove and edit books in your given online bookshelf as well as add an extra Library component to the app as the brief required 4 components. In the Library component there is a selection of books to view, I felt this may help a user in picking a new type of book. As for the css that was used I installed angular materials where I then used prebuilt themes for my components. This is a very simple app i'm happy with the outcome of my app from the start to end i kept the idea of making a bookshelf and never decided to change it.
